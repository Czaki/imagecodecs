Decode DICOM Transfer Syntax 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70 and
1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57
JPEG Lossless, Nonhierarchical
see ISO/IEC 10918-1 / ITU T.81
specifically, format with 'Start of Frame' (SOF) code 0xC3
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/JPEG/itu-t81.pdf
This code decodes data with 1..16 bits per pixel
It appears unique to medical imaging, and is not supported by most
JPEG libraries
